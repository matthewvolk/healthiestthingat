I've suddenly found myself travelling much more often, and end up pulling into the drive-thru more than I'd like to admit. I'd like to have a hand-held database showing me an interactive menu for every restaurant in the world, that I can filter by diet preference or nutritional value. 
Also, I wanted to learn PostgreSQL and thought this was the perfect opportunity to do so.
