## Project Background/TODO:
#### THE PROBLEM:
I've suddenly found myself travelling much more often, and end up pulling into the drive-thru more than I'd like to admit. I'd like to have a hand-held database showing me an interactive menu for every restaurant in the world, that I can filter by diet preference or nutritional value. 
Also, I wanted to learn PostgreSQL and thought this was the perfect opportunity to do so. 

#### THE GOAL: 
The goal is to be more convenient than manually looking up the nutritional information of a menu item you are about to purchase while eating out. 

#### CURRENT PROGRESS:
* Currently refactoring the backend API to serve a React.js frontend
* The live site right now is just Node/Express and jQuery/Javscript

#### TO DO:
* Refactor API to handle data manipulation such as search, filtering, and sorting.
* Refactor front end to serve a React front end
* Add advterising opportunities for sponsors

#### Issues/Security Concerns:
* N/A
